## General Information
- This project, titled "Deep Learning for Image Classification: A CNN Approach", focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.
- The background of this project lies in the increasing need for automated systems capable of image recognition and classification, which has applications in various fields such as healthcare, security, and autonomous vehicles.
- The business problem this project addresses is the automation of image classification tasks, which can help doctors save time and resources, and increase efficiency.
- The dataset used in this project consists of images that need to be classified. The exact nature of the images (e.g., actinic keratosis, nevus, basal cell carcinoma, etc.) can vary based on the specific use case.


## Conclusions

Through the application of data augmentation techniques and rebalancing of classes, significant enhancements were observed in the model's performance. The improvements are summarized as follows:

1. **Increased Accuracy:**
   - Both training and validation accuracy experienced notable improvements, indicating enhanced learning capabilities of the model.

2. **Reduced Loss:**
   - The training and validation loss decreased, showcasing improved generalization and reduced overfitting compared to the previous model run.

3. **Addressed Class Imbalance:**
   - The class imbalance issue was effectively mitigated by augmenting the minority classes with additional samples.
   - This led to a more balanced distribution of samples across all classes, improving the model's ability to handle diverse data.

4. **Robust Model:**
   - The overall improvements suggest that the model has become more robust, demonstrating increased resilience and accuracy in making predictions.

These outcomes collectively indicate that the model, after optimization, is well-equipped to provide accurate and reliable predictions on the given dataset.
